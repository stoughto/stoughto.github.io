  The rich astronomical knowledge of Brazil’s Indigenous communities,
  such as the Tupi, Guarani, and Tukano peoples teaches us how
  they mapped the heavens, using constellations not just for
  storytelling but also as vital guides for agriculture, navigation,
  and spiritual life.

  Celestial phenomena—like the
  Milky Way, eclipses, and planetary movements—were woven into myths,
  rituals, and seasonal calendars. Set against the backdrop of modern
  Rio de Janeiro, with its dramatic skyline and Sugarloaf Mountain,
  the presentation draws connections between ancient cosmologies and
  contemporary astronomy, inviting reflection on how different ways of
  seeing the sky continue to shape cultural identity and scientific
  curiosity.
