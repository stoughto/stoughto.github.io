The Norse imagined a universe shaped by mighty gods, world trees, and
cosmic beasts — a vision both grand and mysterious.  We’ll bridge the
ancient with the modern, exploring how Nordic cosmology echoes through
today’s scientific understanding of the universe. From the concept of
Yggdrasil, the World Tree, to contemporary ideas about cosmic
structures, and from Ragnarök to theories of cosmic rebirth, we’ll see
how myth and science often ask the same timeless questions. Join us as
we sail through the realms of imagination and reality, tracing the
deep human desire to explain the mysteries of the stars.
