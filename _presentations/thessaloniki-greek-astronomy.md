title:  "Thessaloniki: Stargazing, Saints, and the Science of Easter"
tagline: Thessaloniki isn’t just a modern port city—it’s a time machine that spans empires, faiths, and the stars.  Founded in 315 B.C., this vibrant northern Greek city became a cultural and intellectual bridge between the ancient and Christian worlds.

  While trade bustled in its harbor and philosophers gathered in its
  streets, Thessaloniki quietly became a key player in the evolution
  of astronomy—not just for skywatching, but for something far more
  earthly: the Church calendar.


  Thanks to its ties with great centers like Alexandria, home to
  astronomical legends like Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Thessaloniki
  inherited a rich scientific tradition.  In this city, faith and
  astronomy didn’t clash—they collaborated.


  Marvel at Byzantine churches adorned with celestial iconography,
  stroll through the Rotunda and ancient Roman ruins, or enjoy
  panoramic views of the Thermaic Gulf.  Modern Thessaloniki
  celebrates this heritage through planetariums, universities, and
  museums that still look to the heavens for inspiration.


  In Thessaloniki, the stars weren’t just studied—they helped guide
  sacred time. And they still shine above a city where science,
  spirit, and story beautifully intertwine.
