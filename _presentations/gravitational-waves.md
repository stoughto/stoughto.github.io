title: Surfing on Gravitational Waves
tagline: Einstein predicted them—but never thought we’d catch them. A century later, scientists heard the cosmic “chirps” of black holes colliding. Discover how we learned to detect ripples in spacetime itself and what it really takes to ride a gravitational wave.

Who knew that spacetime itself could ripple like the surface of the
ocean?  Einstein!  When he predicted it would happen, he also said
that the ripples would be too small for us to ever see.  100 years
later, decades of painstaking work culminated in the detection of
“chirps” from the collisions of distant black holes.  We’ll see what
it takes to surf on gravitational waves.
