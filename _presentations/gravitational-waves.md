title: Surfing on Gravitational Waves
tagline: Einstein predicted them—but never thought we’d catch them. A century later, scientists heard the cosmic “chirps” of black holes colliding. Discover how we learned to detect ripples in spacetime itself and what it really takes to ride a gravitational wave.

  Who knew that spacetime itself could ripple like the surface of the
  ocean?  Einstein!  When he predicted it would happen, he also said
  that the ripples would be too small for us to ever see.  100 years
  later, decades of painstaking work culminated in the detection of
  “chirps” from the collisions of distant black holes.  We’ll see what
  it takes to surf on gravitational waves.

  This is a story of how humanity achieved something amazing and
  opened up a whole new way to study the cosmos. Come learn how we
  found a way to “listen” to the universe, and what that means for our
  understanding of everything around us.

  <p>
  As we detect more waves, we’ll be able to see deeper into space than
  ever before. These ripples can tell us about things like black hole
  collisions, mergers of neutron stars, and even the mysterious birth
  of the universe itself.
