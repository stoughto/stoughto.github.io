  Mechanical clocks were vital in maritime history, enabling precise
  timekeeping for navigation and coordination at sea. Before accurate
  clocks, sailors struggled to determine longitude, as it required
  comparing local time (via the sun) with a reference time (e.g.,
  Greenwich). By the 18th century, marine chronometers—reliable,
  portable mechanical clocks—solved this, allowing ships to calculate
  their position accurately, reducing navigational errors and saving
  lives. Clocks also synchronized shipboard activities, such as watch
  changes and log-keeping, ensuring operational efficiency during long
  voyages.


  At Castle Cornet in Guernsey, the mechanical clock in the clock
  tower, with its visible gears and large bell, commemorates this
  maritime legacy. Positioned in a fortress overlooking St. Peter Port
  harbour, the clock symbolizes the role of timekeeping in Guernsey’s
  seafaring history, where accurate timing was crucial for trade,
  defense, and navigation in the English Channel. Its exposed
  mechanics serve as an educational exhibit, highlighting the
  technological ingenuity that transformed maritime travel, while its
  bell likely marked time for harbour activities, echoing the rhythm
  of a port reliant on precise schedules.
