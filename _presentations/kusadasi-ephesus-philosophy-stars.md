  We walk the paths where ancient sages crafted ideas which led to
  modern science.

  Near modern-day Kuşadası lies Ephesus, one of the great intellectual
  centers of the ancient world. It was home to Heraclitus, a
  pre-Socratic philosopher who laid early groundwork for understanding
  cosmic order, emphasizing change and the unity of opposites—a
  concept that resonated with later astronomical cycles. More
  importantly, the wider Ionian region, including nearby Miletus,
  produced some of the earliest scientific thinkers like Thales and
  Anaximander. These pioneers rejected myth in favor of observation
  and logic, proposing that celestial bodies moved according to
  natural laws—an essential shift that launched Greek astronomy as a
  scientific discipline.


  Known in antiquity as Byzantium and later as Constantinople,
  Istanbul served as a vital cultural and intellectual bridge between
  East and West. During the Byzantine era, it preserved and expanded
  upon ancient Greek astronomical texts while integrating insights
  from Persian, Arab, and later European traditions. Scholars here
  maintained detailed star catalogs, planetary models, and timekeeping
  systems used for religious observances, navigation, and
  astrology. The famed Hagia Sophia itself was aligned with cosmic
  symbolism, and Byzantine scientists contributed to the continuity of
  astronomical knowledge during Europe's early medieval period.
