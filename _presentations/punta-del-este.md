title: "Where the Sky Meets the Sea: South Atlantic Cosmologies and Ancient Timekeepers"
tagline: "There’s something poetic about standing in Punta del Este, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Río de la Plata, and looking up at the stars. This is a literal and symbolic place of convergence: sea and sky, old world and new, earthly journeys and celestial visions.  The Charrúa and the Guarani, lived in deep connection with the rhythms of nature—and with the sky."

  Explores a region that has long served as a meeting point: between
  continents, cultures, and cosmic worldviews.

  Long before ships crossed from Europe to these shores, the
  Indigenous peoples of the region—particularly the Charrúa and the
  Guarani—looked to the heavens as a living map. They read the stars
  and moon not just for orientation, but to guide hunting, planting,
  migration, and ceremonial life. Their cosmologies were deeply
  intertwined with the cycles of the natural world, with
  constellations marking the passage of time, signaling the changing
  seasons, and anchoring stories of creation and ancestral wisdom.

  This presentation highlights how the sky served as both compass and
  calendar, and how Indigenous knowledge systems shaped a
  sophisticated understanding of time and space. In a place where sea
  breezes carry echoes of ancient songs and starlight touches the
  tides, we reflect on the enduring human impulse to look upward—for
  meaning, direction, and a sense of belonging in the universe.
