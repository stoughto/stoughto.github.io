  Exercise your imagination as we embark on an extraordinary voyage to
  the icy realms of Jupiter’s moons—once faint specks in Galileo’s
  telescope, now our next extraterrestrial cruise destination. You’ll
  learn what to pack for a journey through intense radiation belts and
  subzero temperatures, how to plan excursions across Europa’s frozen
  seas, Ganymede’s grooved terrain, and Io’s volcanic plains, and why
  Callisto’s ancient craters make it a perfect base camp. We’ll also
  explore the tantalizing possibility of life beneath Europa’s ice and
  imagine what it would be like to meet a local guide from another
  world. Get ready to chart your course for adventure to the gas
  giant!
