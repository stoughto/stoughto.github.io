title:  "Heroes, Hunters & the Heavenly Zoo"
tagline: The night sky isn’t just stars—it’s a cosmic comic book, a glowing tapestry of gods, monsters, and epic showdowns. Every constellation has a tale, and ancient Greece wrote them in starlight.

  Take Orion, the swaggering hunter who bragged he could slay every
  beast on Earth. Mother Earth didn’t love the ego—so she sent a
  scorpion to humble him. Now, Orion and Scorpius play an eternal game
  of celestial hide-and-seek, forever chasing but never
  meeting. Drama? Oh yes—intergalactic drama.


  Then there’s Andromeda, chained to a rock with a sea monster closing
  in. Just when things look grim, in swoops Perseus—fresh off
  defeating Medusa, no less—riding the winged horse Pegasus like the
  hero he is. He slays the monster, marries the princess, and boom!
  Their whole mythological crew—Andromeda, Perseus, Pegasus,
  Cassiopeia, and even the sea monster Cetus—gets prime real estate in
  the stars.


  From Hercules to Ursa Major, from Cygnus the swan to an actual
  unicorn (yes, really), the sky is packed with characters you don’t
  want to miss.


  Once you know their stories, stargazing will never be the same. The
  heavens become a stage—and the myths, alive again.
