  Ketchikan is more than Alaska’s first city—it is the southern
  gateway to the Tongass National Forest, the largest temperate
  rainforest on Earth. In this talk, we explore how this vast,
  mist-shrouded wilderness has shaped every part of life in and around
  Ketchikan, from Indigenous traditions to the modern fishing
  industry.
  
  <p>
  At the heart of the story are the Tlingit people, who have lived in
  balance with the land for thousands of years. Their deep respect for
  the forest is evident in intricate totem poles, longhouse carvings,
  and oral histories rooted in cedar, salmon, and the spirit of
  place. We’ll discuss how the Tongass isn’t just trees—it’s a
  cultural landscape.
  
  <p>
  You’ll also hear how Ketchikan rose to prominence through the salmon
  trade, logging, and maritime commerce—industries made possible by
  the natural wealth of the forest and sea. But the Tongass is more
  than a resource; it is a living system, home to bald eagles, black
  bears, Sitka spruce, and some of the purest rivers in North America.
  
  <p>
  We’ll examine current conservation challenges and why the Tongass
  remains a vital part of the global climate system—a carbon sink, a
  habitat refuge, and a living legacy.
