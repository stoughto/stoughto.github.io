title: "Ancient Amazon Cosmology"
tagline: The cosmology of the Amazonian peoples is vast, diverse, and deeply interwoven with their environment.  Indigenous groups have developed sophisticated worldviews in which the sky, earth, rivers, and spirits are all interconnected. Their understanding of the cosmos forms the foundation of their cultural identity and way of life.

  Many Amazonian cultures envision the universe as consisting of
  multiple vertical layers.  This three-tiered cosmos is not
  metaphorical—it is often navigated in shamanic journeys, rituals,
  and storytelling. Shamans are believed to travel between these
  worlds through dreams, trance, or the use of plant medicines like
  ayahuasca, guided by celestial and spiritual beings.


  The sun, moon, and stars are living beings.  In Amazonian
  cosmologies, celestial bodies are not inanimate objects—they are
  living beings or ancestors.


  One of the most striking motifs in Amazonian cosmology is the
  anaconda or cosmic serpent, which is often seen as a creator-being
  or divine presence linking sky, water, and land.


  What makes Amazonian cosmology unique is its deep sense of
  relationality. The stars are not separate from the rivers, and
  humans are not separate from the animals or spirits. Everything is
  interconnected, and the cosmos is a living system, constantly in
  flux, renewal, and conversation.


  Amazonian people don’t observe the cosmos from a distance—they are
  participants in it. Their myths, songs, and rituals don’t just
  describe the stars—they maintain the balance of the cosmos itself.
