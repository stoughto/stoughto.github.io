title: "Kuşadası:  Reaching for the Stars"
tagline: "Long before telescopes and space probes, the journey to understand the cosmos began with questions—big ones. In the lands around Kuşadası and Ephesus, ancient minds gazed upward and dared to ask: What if the stars obeyed laws, not gods?"

  Ephesus, once a glittering hub of ancient intellect, was home to
  Heraclitus, the philosopher of fire and flux. He believed that
  change is the only constant and that opposites are part of a greater
  unity—ideas that echo through the rhythmic dance of planets and
  stars. Nearby, in Miletus, thinkers like Thales and Anaximander
  launched a revolution of the mind. They stepped away from myth and
  embraced observation, declaring that the heavens moved by natural
  laws. It was here that science first took root in the sky.


  Fast forward a few centuries to Istanbul—known as Byzantium and
  later Constantinople—the cultural crossroads of East and West. While
  Europe drifted through the early Middle Ages, Byzantine scholars
  were busy preserving ancient Greek star maps, refining planetary
  models, and blending knowledge from Persian, Arab, and later
  European traditions. Their observatories and manuscripts kept the
  light of astronomy burning. Even the Hagia Sophia, with its
  celestial symbolism, stands as a testament to this union of science,
  spirit, and sky.


  This is the story of how sacred skywatching became scientific
  astronomy—born in Ionia, nurtured in Byzantium, and still unfolding
  above us.
