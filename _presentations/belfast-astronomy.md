  Founded by Archbishop Richard Robinson, Armagh Observaotry is one of
  the oldest scientific institutions in the British Isles still active
  in research. Perched on a hill in Northern Ireland, it became a key
  center for astronomy, meteorology, and timekeeping, maintaining one
  of the world’s longest continuous weather records. The observatory
  has played a vital role in tracking stars, comets, and planetary
  motion, bridging centuries of celestial discovery.


  Among Belfast’s most distinguished scientific figures is Lord Kelvin
  (William Thomson), born in 1824. A pioneer in thermodynamics and
  electrical theory, he helped lay the foundations of modern physics
  and proposed a dynamic, evolving model of the Earth—ideas that would
  influence both astronomy and cosmology.
