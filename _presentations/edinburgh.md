title: "From Scotland to the the Big Bang"
tagline: Combining Vicotorian grandeur with utility, the Royal Observatory Edinburgh has made major contributions to astronomy, from early star mapping and astrometry in the 19th century to pioneering infrared astronomy through work on the UK Infrared Telescope.

  In its early years, the observatory focused on astrometry—precise
  measurements of star positions and motions—which supported global
  efforts in celestial navigation and mapping. By the mid-20th
  century, ROE became a leader in infrared astronomy, contributing to
  the development and operation of the UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT),
  which began observations in Hawaii in 1979. This opened new windows
  on the universe, revealing cool stars, star-forming regions, and
  galactic structures invisible in optical light.


  In 1998, the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC) was formed at
  ROE, establishing it as a world leader in astronomical
  instrumentation. UK ATC has contributed major components to flagship
  projects like the James Webb Space Telescope (launched 2021) and the
  European Space Agency’s Euclid mission (launched 2023), which is
  investigating dark energy and the expansion of the universe. In
  parallel, ROE has taken a central role in sky survey science,
  building and supporting instruments for telescopes such as VISTA
  (commissioned 2009), which performs large-scale infrared surveys
  from Chile, and contributing to the data architecture of the Vera
  C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), set
  to begin full operations in the mid-2020s.


  Through its blend of heritage, engineering innovation, and data
  science, ROE continues to shape our understanding of the cosmos—from
  charting the heavens in the 1800s to unlocking the secrets of dark
  matter and distant galaxies in the 21st century.
