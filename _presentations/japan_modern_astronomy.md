title: Astronomy in Japan
tagline: "Modern Japanese astronomy stands at the forefront of global space science and observation, blending cutting-edge technology with a deep cultural reverence for the cosmos.From the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, to space missions to retrieve samples from asteriods, to a range of radio telecopes, it continues to expand our understanding of the universe while inspiring awe and discovery both locally and worldwide."

The Subaru Telescope has an exceptional wide-field, high-resolution
view of deep space, which has led to major discoveries in galaxy
formation, dark matter, dark energy, and exoplanets.

Japan’s Hayabusa was the first mission to return asteroid samples to
Earth. Launched in 2003, it arrived at Itokawa in 2005, collected tiny
grains (less than 1 milligram) using a projectile impact method, and
returned them in 2010 despite technical challenges like a failed rover
and navigation issues.  This confirmed Itokawa’s composition as an
S-type asteroid rich in silicates and provided insights into asteroid
surface processes.

A group of Radio Telescopes in Japan has, among other achievements,
contributed to creating a three-dimensional map of the Milky Way
Galaxy.
