title: "Edvard Grieg:  Music of Earth and Sky"
tagline: Let the music of Edvard Grieg guide you through Norway’s soul—its soaring fjords, shimmering skies, and ancient Norse legends. Though born in Bergen, Grieg only truly “discovered” Norway after studying abroad, returning with melodies that captured the magic of his homeland.  His music weaves together nature, myth, and memory into a timeless symphony of Earth and sky.

Edvard Grieg’s music is filled with the spirit of Norway — not only its mountains and fjords, but also the vast skies and ancient myths that shaped its soul.   Grieg captured the wonder of nature and the cosmos, drawing inspiration from a landscape where the stars, the seas, and the old Norse stories were deeply intertwined.  A Bergen native, he did not “discover” Norway until he studied music abroad!   As we sail past dramatic cliffs and wide northern skies, we’ll hear how Grieg’s melodies reflect a timeless world where the earth and heavens are alive with music, mystery, and memory.
