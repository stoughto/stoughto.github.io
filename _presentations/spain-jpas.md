title: "Spain's Window to the Stars"
tagline: "Spanish influence in global space science continues a rich legacy of astronomical discovery dating back to the Middle Ages.  So as we enjoy the beauty of Spain’s coast from the sea, remember: this country isn’t just famous for its wine, music, and historic cities—it’s also helping to chart the very structure of the universe."

  From mountaintop observatories to cutting-edge data, Spain is
  helping unlock some of the universe’s biggest mysteries—all while
  offering a new, colorful way to view the night sky.  Most sky
  surveys use just a few filters—broad bands of red, green, or blue—to
  capture celestial objects. But J-PAS is using 56 different filters,
  each tuned to a very narrow slice of light.


  It’s like going from a basic snapshot to a full-color medical scan
  of the sky—not just seeing how things look, but learning what
  they’re made of, how fast they’re moving, and how far away they
  are. With this technique, astronomers can create a 3D map of the
  universe, showing how galaxies are scattered across space and time.
  It’s no coincidence this project is happening here. Spain has a long
  and proud history of astronomy, from ancient Arabic star charts in
  medieval Toledo to today’s high-tech observatories in the Canary
  Islands and mainland Spain. With clear skies, high elevations, and
  international partnerships, Spain has become one of the best places
  in the world to study the night sky.
