title: "Glaciers and Tsunamis:  Nature's Hidden Power"
tagline: Glaciers may seem slow and silent, but they shape the land in ways that can trigger sudden, towering tsunamis. In Alaska’s rugged fjords, ice, rock, and gravity collide in one of nature’s most powerful—and least expected—forces.

  As we cruise through Alaska’s breathtaking glacial landscapes, you
  might not think of tsunamis—but the two are closely linked in ways
  that surprise many people.

  Glaciers are powerful sculptors of the land. As they carve through
  valleys and retreat, they leave behind steep slopes and unstable
  ground. When the ice melts and pulls back—especially rapidly—it can
  cause those mountainsides to weaken.

  Sometimes, huge chunks of rock collapse into fjords or bays
  below. When that happens suddenly, it can displace massive amounts
  of water—triggering what's known as a glacial tsunami or
  landslide-generated tsunami.

  One dramatic example occurred in Icy Bay in 2015, when a landslide
  triggered a wave over 600 feet high—one of the tallest tsunamis ever
  recorded. Unlike oceanic tsunamis caused by earthquakes, these
  glacial tsunamis happen locally, but they can be just as
  destructive.

  As Alaska's glaciers continue to melt due to climate change,
  scientists are keeping a close eye on these high-risk areas using
  satellites and ground sensors.

  So while glaciers seem calm and slow-moving, they’re part of a much
  bigger and more dynamic Earth system—one capable of unleashing
  sudden, spectacular force.
