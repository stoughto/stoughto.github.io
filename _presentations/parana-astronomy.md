tagline: In this historic port town, we trace the connection between astronomy and ancient trade. Learn how Indigenous groups like the Guarani used the stars for seasonal timing and ritual, while also considering how the port itself became a meeting point of sky-inspired worldviews.

  According to indigenous cosmology, the design, which is visible in
  the autumn and winter periods, symbolizes times of cold and
  scarcity.  The Ema Constellation involves stars that are
  traditionally grouped in other constellations, such as Scorpio and
  the Southern Cross. The silhouette of the bird, in the view of the
  Guarani, arises from the contrast between the lighter and darker
  parts of the Milky Way.

  In Paraná, the Guarani people developed a sophisticated
  understanding of the night sky, using it to structure both their
  daily lives and spiritual practices. Key constellations—such as the
  Ema (representing a large flightless bird similar to an ostrich) and
  the Old Man (Tupa Rendy)—served as celestial calendars. Their rising
  or setting marked important seasonal transitions, such as the
  beginning of planting or harvesting periods.

  These astronomical observations were deeply interwoven with ritual
  life. Seasonal ceremonies were often timed to coincide with the
  appearance of certain stars, reflecting the Guarani belief that the
  cosmos was a living, sacred order. The stars were seen as ancestral
  beings or messengers, connecting the terrestrial world to the
  divine. Through skywatching, the Guarani maintained a harmonious
  relationship with nature, ensuring that both subsistence and
  spiritual life followed the rhythms of the universe.
