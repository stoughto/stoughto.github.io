  We have all been on great shore excursions, but John Glenn’s trip to
  the Grand Turk Island takes the cake!  We’ll recall that journey and
  pay tribute to all the geeks with pocket protectors and slide rules.


  This wasn’t just a daring feat of exploration; it was the
  culmination of tireless work by brilliant minds in lab coats, armed
  with slide rules, chalkboards, and Cold War urgency.


  Every second of John Glenn’s mission had to be planned with surgical
  accuracy.  Space travel in 1962 was anything but routine.  The
  mission's success relied on hundreds of unsung heroes: engineers
  designing life-support systems from scratch, women like Katherine
  Johnson calculating trajectories by hand, and technicians modifying
  military hardware for space travel. They weren’t just pushing
  boundaries—they were creating a playbook for spaceflight as they
  went.
