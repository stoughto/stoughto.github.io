  Indigenous coastal tribes and early fishermen relied on the stars
  not just for navigation, but as guides to tides, migration patterns,
  and seasonal weather shifts.

  Through storytelling, star maps, and traditional practices, the talk
  reveals how celestial bodies—like the Southern Cross, Venus (often
  known as the “morning star” or “evening star”), and lunar
  phases—were integrated into fishing schedules, rituals, and oral
  traditions. Listeners will gain insight into how these sky-based
  systems formed a kind of maritime cosmology, blending practical
  survival with spiritual meaning. The presentation also touches on
  how some of these ancient practices persist today, offering a
  reflection on cultural continuity and the enduring human connection
  to both the ocean and the stars.
