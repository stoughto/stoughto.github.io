  Solobservatoriet was established to monitor solar activity,
  especially sunspots and solar flares, which affect Earth's magnetic
  field. It contributed to early research on how solar storms
  influence radio communications and navigation—critical during the
  Cold War.


  Scientists used the observatory to track and analyze the aurora
  borealis (northern lights), helping to improve understanding of the
  interaction between solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field,
  especially in polar regions.


  The observatory supported upper atmospheric measurements and studies
  of the ionosphere, which were vital for understanding how solar
  radiation affects Earth’s atmosphere.


  As part of international collaborations (notably with NATO and
  European scientific networks), Solobservatoriet helped build early
  global models of geomagnetic activity and contributed to
  standardized solar monitoring efforts.


  Today, Solobservatoriet stands as a tribute to that pioneering
  spirit. It features historic instruments, original research
  buildings, and hands-on exhibits. The experience includes guided
  sessions highlighting the observatory’s role during the space race,
  its contributions to international science, and—when weather
  allows—a chance to observe the sun or night sky through powerful
  telescopes.
