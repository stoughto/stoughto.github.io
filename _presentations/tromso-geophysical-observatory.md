  Welcome to Tromsø, one of the most important centers for aurora
  research in the world. Just outside the city lies the Tromsø
  Geophysical Observatory, part of the University of Tromsø
  (UiT). This facility plays a crucial role in monitoring Earth’s
  magnetic field and tracking auroral activity.


  Why is this important? The aurora borealis—those dazzling lights we
  hope to see tonight—are caused by charged particles from the sun
  colliding with our atmosphere. These interactions disturb Earth’s
  magnetic field, and the observatory carefully measures those
  changes.


  Scientists here have been studying the aurora for over a
  century. Their data help us understand space weather, which can
  affect satellite communications, GPS, and even power grids.


  Tromsø’s unique location under the auroral oval makes it a perfect
  natural laboratory. In fact, it’s known as the “Northern Lights
  capital of the world.” So when you look up tonight and (hopefully)
  see those shimmering lights, know that you’re standing in the heart
  of where science meets spectacle.
