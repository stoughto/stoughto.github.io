title: What's up with Pluto?
tagline: Why isn’t Pluto a planet anymore?  What have we learned since the big change? Get the latest on the New Horizons mission, explore Pluto’s icy surface, and see how its glaciers stack up against Earth’s. Space, science, and a little bit of mystery.

  Pluto may have been demoted from planet to “dwarf planet,” but it’s
  far from boring. In this talk, we’ll unpack the 2006 decision by the
  International Astronomical Union—what criteria led to Pluto’s
  reclassification, and why the debate still rages today.


  Then we’ll
  fast forward to July 2015, when NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew
  past Pluto, sending home breathtaking images of mountains, canyons,
  and heart‑shaped ice plains. You’ll discover how Sputnik Planitia’s
  nitrogen glaciers flow across the surface, how towering water‑ice
  mountains defy expectations, and why cryovolcanism may still be
  active. Finally, we’ll put Pluto’s ice to the test: side‑by‑side
  comparisons with Earth’s glaciers will challenge you to spot the
  differences in composition, temperature, and behavior. By the end,
  you’ll see why Pluto remains one of the most fascinating—and
  surprisingly familiar—worlds in our solar system.
