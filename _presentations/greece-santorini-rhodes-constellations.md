title: "Santorini and Rhodes:  Where Myths Meet the Stars"
tagline: In Greece, mythology isn’t just carved into marble or whispered through ruins—it blazes across the sky.  Santorini and Rhodes are two islands where ancient stories didn’t just happen—-they erupted, gleamed, and reached for the heavens.

  When you explore Santorini’s caldera or Rhodes’ sunlit harbor,
  you’re walking through places where Earth and sky once met in myth
  and marvel.


  Around 1600 B.C, Santorini exploded in one of the most powerful
  volcanic events in human history. The Aegean trembled—and the
  imagination of the ancient world ignited. Many believe this
  cataclysm inspired the legend of Atlantis. To the people of the
  time, such devastation wasn’t chance—it was a divine
  message. Cosmic. A celestial warning written in ash and fire.


  Far to the east, Rhodes basked in the radiance of Helios, the sun
  god himself. The island’s crowning glory, the Colossus of Rhodes—one
  of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World—stood as a gleaming
  tribute to light, power, and celestial harmony. Its legacy even
  extends to science: helium, the only element first discovered beyond
  Earth, takes its name from this solar god.


  Mythology meets early science, and storytelling
  evolved into skywatching. The ancient Greeks didn’t just imagine the
  cosmos—they observed it, mapped it, and gave it meaning.
