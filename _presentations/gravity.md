title: "Gravity is not so Simple After All!"
tagline: Einstein's Copenhagen Problem -- Gravity is one of the deepest mysteries in modern physics, refusing to play by the same rules as the quantum world. This talk explores how scientists are testing gravity in bold new ways, from dark matter to extra dimensions, revealing why the universe’s oldest force might just be its most puzzling.

  Gravity might seem like the simplest force in nature—just ask
  Newton’s falling apple. But when you look closer, gravity becomes one
  of the biggest puzzles in physics. Einstein’s theory of general
  relativity revolutionized our understanding by showing that mass
  curves spacetime itself.


  Yet even today, gravity refuses to fit
  neatly with quantum mechanics, the theory that governs the very
  small. This mismatch hints at the deep tension between relativity and
  quantum physics.  We’ll start with the everyday experience of falling
  objects and expand into the strange and fascinating problems gravity
  poses across the universe. Why can’t we reconcile gravity with
  quantum theory? What’s happening with mysterious dark matter and dark
  energy, which seem to dominate the cosmos? And why are researchers
  testing gravity at incredibly small distances to search for hidden
  forces or extra dimensions?


  We’ll explore some of the most exciting
  modern experiments — ultra-sensitive interferometers with light or
  atoms; lunar distance measurement; and microdiamonds that are in two
  places at the same time — probing gravity in ways Einstein could only
  have dreamed of. Join me to discover why gravity, the oldest force
  we’ve studied, may also be the newest frontier in physics.
