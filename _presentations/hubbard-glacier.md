title: Dynamic Hubbard Glacier
tagline: From the rugged coastlines of eastern Alaska to the wild expanse of Yukon, Canada, the Hubbard Glacier stands as an ancient force of natureâ€”immense, unyielding, and alive with motion. It carves through mountains with glacial patience, dams mighty fjords with silent strength, and advances ever forward with the quiet, relentless power of time itself.

  The Hubbard Glacier, located in eastern Alaska and extending into
  Yukon, Canada, is one of the most dynamic tidewater glaciers in
  North America.  Hubbard has been advancing for over a century. This
  behavior offers a unique case study in glaciology, driven by local
  climatic, oceanographic, and topographic factors. In the past,
  Hubbard Glacier has experienced episodic surges, notably damming
  Russell Fjord in 1986 and 2002, leading to significant environmental
  impacts. In the present, it continues to exhibit complex flow
  patterns and terminus advances, defying broader regional trends of
  glacial retreat.
