In 1611, King James I of England gifted Japan what was then the
 pinnacle of scientific achievement: a magnificent two-meter-long
 telescope, encased in silver and richly decorated with gold. This
 extraordinary instrument not only represented the cutting edge of
 17th-century technology, but also symbolized a gesture of diplomacy
 and curiosity between distant cultures. Though the original telescope
 has long since disappeared—most likely lost to fire or simply the
 erosion of time—its story endures as a remarkable moment in early
 scientific exchange. Four centuries later, in a tribute to that
 historic gesture, the Japan400 Presentation Telescope was gifted to
 Japan, celebrating both the legacy of the original and the enduring
 relationship between the two nations.
